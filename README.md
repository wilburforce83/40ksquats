# Squats / Space Dwarf Model Collection

A curated repository of all Squat STL file I have found / modelled / modified for my own Squat army.

## Details

This is as whole a collection for Squats as I have at the moment. I will be modifying and building few more vehicles for use with squats too.

### Aquilla / Logo

I have made a simple aquilla which can be scaled for use on banners, terrain or vehicles etc. The design is taken from an old White Dwarf image:

## Rules

### Kill Team

I have added rules for 40K Kill Team from Art of War Studios

### 40K

I can't find a full set of rules anywhere, and don't have time, but I have just used IG and proxied - I would like to write rules -- If someone is interested I could add them here.

### Grimdark Future

I have added the most recent GF rules here.
